==========================
Group Members: Lise Ho and Christina Ko from Period 2
Description: This is our Game Center. It currently holds three games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-4 and a Trivia Game. To use our game center, please compile Gui.java .
What works:
     Tic-Tac-Toe easy and hard levels both work. The Trivia also works. The High Score chart works with the exception of the ConnectFour column. Players are able to change their profiles as well via the high score screen.
What does not work:
     ConnectFour is not completely implemented as we hoped. <- We will go back and fix this even if you grade our project first.
Data structures used: We used priority queues in GUI.java to store scores
